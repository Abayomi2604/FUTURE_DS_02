## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the performance of a marketing campaign using Power BI.  
The goal was to easure **ROI (Return on Investment)** and identify which factors contributed most to campaign profitability.  

The analysis was built around key performance indicators (KPIs) and DAX measures, then visualized in an interactive Power BI dashboard.

## 🔑 Key Metrics
- **Total Impression** – the total number of times campaign ads were shown (served) to people.  
- **Average Engagement** – measures how much, on average, people interacted with your ad/content.  
- **Total Conversion** = the number of people who completed the desired action (purchase, signup, download, etc.).
- **ROI (%)** = `(Profit / Marketing Spend) * 100`  
- **Total Clicks (%)** = the sum of all recorded clicks in your campaign.

## ⚙️ DAX Measures Used
```DAX
Profit = SUM('Data'[Revenue]) - SUM('Data'[Marketing Spend])

ROI (%) = 
DIVIDE([Profit], SUM('Data'[Marketing Spend])) * 100

Conversion Rate (%) =
DIVIDE(SUM('Data'[Conversions]), SUM('Data'[Impressions])) * 100
