## ‚öôÔ∏è DAX Measures Used
```DAX
Average Engagement = AVERAGE ('Data'[Total Engagement])
Total Clicks = SUM ('Data' [Clicks])

Total ROI (%) = SUM ('Data' [ROI])
Total conversion = SUM ('Data' [Conversion])
CTR % = DIVIDE([Total Clicks], [Total Impressions], 0)
Conversion Rate = DIVIDE([Total Conversions], [Total Clicks], 0)
